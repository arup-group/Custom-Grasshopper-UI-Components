# Template for Custom Grasshopper components

This project is a template repo for creating Custom Grasshopper components with UI overrides.

Three components are provided in the template; a clickable button, two dropdown menus and a slider. You can change the colours easily, and you can use the code to combine buttons, sliders and dropdowns.
